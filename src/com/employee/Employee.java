 * This class is where I define the basic structure and behaviors that all employees should have.

 * I use it as a foundation, and other employee types (like Full-Time and Part-Time) build on this.
 *
 * Since it's an abstract class, I can't create an Employee directly from this.
 * Instead, subclasses like FullTimeEmployee and PartTimeEmployee will extend it and provide more specific details.
